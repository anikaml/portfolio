    details: "Stalue is a platform built to create and update price predictions for assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies using the power of machine learning. The main component of the website is a stock price chart, done using ChartJS. One of the biggest challenges was to design a chart which will show current and historical prices in a clean readable way. I have done it splitting chart into two tabs. The default is a current tab showing Tesla stock price. User can also switch to historical tab and select the historical date to see previous prices on a given day. How much stock options is showed depends on the user plan. After signing up, user can buy pro tier, cancel subscription or renew it using Stripe components.",
